Unfortunately, due to Open Store security policies, a web app must not be "unconfident".

For this reason, the Youtube Music application you installed from the Open Store unfortunately cannot run in the background on its own. For this reason, if you want to listen to music while working with other applications or with the screen off, you have two options.

The first option is to activate the "Prevent app suspension" setting for Youtube Music by installing the UT Tweak Tool application from the Open Store.

As a second and more native option, you can download the Youtube Music installation file from next button to your device, open it with the Open Store and install it. Also title bar and buttons will be hidden if it is installed.

Please note that in the second option, the application is "unconfident" and has full access to the system. This is a risky situation.
